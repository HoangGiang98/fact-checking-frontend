# Fact Checking Frontend

This is the repository that provides UI for the [Fact Checking Backend](https://github.com/HoangGiang98/fact-checking-backend) of the Fact Checking Tool. The Fact Checking Tool is an app that supports document search, evidence retrieval, and realtime claim verification. It employs natural language processing to create a standard pipeline for automated fact checking.
The Fact Checking Tool is a part of the project I participated at the Technical University of Munich.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
